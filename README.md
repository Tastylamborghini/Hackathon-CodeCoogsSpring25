Steganographic System

# WON 1st PLACE

## 📌 Overview  
This project was developed during Create and Innovate Hacthon by CodeCoogs. Our team built a system to embed hidden messages in images using steganographic techniques.

The purpose and Idea of this project was for the CyberSecurity theme of the Create and Innovate Hackathon. Following the theme we created a stegnographic encryption system, which encrypts date into a image. Further mroe we added authentication with encryption and decryption keys.
